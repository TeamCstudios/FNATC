## Characters

#### MrJoCrafter
He will start singing and move towards you door. He will hide from the cameras. The song that he sings will determine what side he attacks. Close the correct door to make him go away. If the lights are off, he will stay at the door and stop singing. If the lights are on and the door is open, he will jumpscare you. He moves faster if the house is cold. If the house is hot, he moves slowly. If 3M1N3M is in the house, he will go back to his spot.

#### Chew
She will message you on IRC. Press R to reply quickly or she will begin spamming you with messages, attracting ??? to your location.

#### DjSlime
He will sneak towards the left door. If the lights are off, he just runs through the doorway, giving you a game over. If the lights are on, he will stand in the door. Close the left door to stop him. He moves faster if the house is hot. If the house is cold, he moves slowly.

#### ZachAttack
He will appear in the front door camera. If he does so, turn the lights off until he is no longer there. If you aren't fast enough, your doors are disabled.

#### LanceThePlaya
If the lights are off for an extended period of time, he will appear in the right door.

#### BobTheBagel
His face will flash on the phone homescreen. You must close the left door.

#### JaredTheBagel
If you keep both doors closed for a long time, he will turn the thermostat up and down.

#### McMagma
If the lights flicker while you're on your phone, take down your phone and close both doors. If you do not do this, McMagma will teleport to a doorway and jumpscare you. The longer the thermostat is on hot, the more likely he attacks.

#### 3M1N3M
He will loudly walk through the front door and walk towards the right door. If the house is cold, he will just leave. If MrJoCrafter is singing, he will stop and yell at him before continuing on.

#### RileyGoughy
When the power goes out, Riley will stand in the door for a while before jumpscaring you.
