## Characters

#### MrJoCrafter
He will start singing and move towards you door. He will hide from the cameras. The song that he sings will determine what side he attacks. Close the correct door to make him go away. If the lights are off, he will stay at the door and stop singing. If the lights are on and the door is open, he will jumpscare you. He moves faster if the house is cold. If the house is hot, he moves slowly.

#### Chew
She will message you on ChatMe. Press R to reply quickly or she will begin spamming you with messages, attracting ??? to your location.

#### DjSlime
He will sneak towards the left door. If the lights are off, he just runs through the doorway, giving you a game over. If the lights are on, he will stand in the door. Close the left door to stop him. He moves faster if the house is hot. If the house is cold, he moves slowly.

#### ZachAttack
He will appear in the front door camera. If he does so, turn the lights off until he is no longer there. If you aren't fast enough, your doors are disabled.

#### LanceThePlaya
He lounges on the couch. If the house is cold AND the lights are on, he will loudly compain. If he complains and you don't change your settings, he moves to the right door and stays there until it opens, jumpscaring you.

#### BobTheBagel
You must check the cameras to find him. Close the door when he is near.

#### JaredTheBagel
He will call your phone repeatedly, lowering your battery. If you don't decline the call quickly, he will constantly turn the thermostat up and down.
